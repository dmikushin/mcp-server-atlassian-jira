## Quick Start

Get up and running in 2 minutes:

### 1. Get Your Jira Credentials

Generate a Jira API Token:
1. Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Give it a name like **"AI Assistant"**
4. **Copy the generated token** immediately (you won't see it again!)

### 2. Try It Instantly

```bash
# Set your credentials
export ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME="your-company"  # for your-company.atlassian.net
export ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL="your.email@company.com"
export ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN="your_api_token"

# List your Jira projects
npx -y @dmikushin/mcp-server-atlassian-jira ls-projects

# Get details about a specific project
npx -y @dmikushin/mcp-server-atlassian-jira get-project --project-key-or-id DEV

# Search for issues
npx -y @dmikushin/mcp-server-atlassian-jira ls-issues --project-key-or-id DEV
```

## Connect to AI Assistants

### For Claude Desktop Users

Add this to your Claude configuration file (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@dmikushin/mcp-server-atlassian-jira"],
      "env": {
        "ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME": "your-company",
        "ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "your.email@company.com",
        "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop, and you'll see "üîó jira" in the status bar.

### For Other AI Assistants

Most AI assistants support MCP. Install the server globally:

```bash
npm install -g @dmikushin/mcp-server-atlassian-jira
```

Then configure your AI assistant to use the MCP server with STDIO transport.

### Alternative: Configuration File

Create `~/.mcp/configs.json` for system-wide configuration:

```json
{
  "jira": {
    "environments": {
      "ATLASSIAN_SITE_NAME": "your-company",
      "ATLASSIAN_USER_EMAIL": "your.email@company.com",
      "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN": "your_api_token"
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative config keys:** The system also accepts `"atlassian-jira"`, `"@dmikushin/mcp-server-atlassian-jira"`, or `"mcp-server-atlassian-jira"` instead of `"jira"`.

## Real-World Examples

### üìã Explore Your Projects

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"List all projects I have access to"*
- *"Show me details about the DEV project"*  
- *"What projects contain the word 'Platform'?"*
- *"Get project information for PROJ-123"*

### üîç Search and Track Issues

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"Find all high priority issues in the DEV project"*
- *"Show me issues assigned to me that are in progress"*
- *"Search for bugs reported in the last week"*
- *"List all open issues for the mobile team"*

### üìù Manage Issue Details

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"Get full details about issue PROJ-456 including comments"*
- *"Show me the development information for PROJ-789"*
- *"What's the current status and assignee of PROJ-123?"*
- *"Display all comments on the authentication bug"*

### üí¨ Issue Communication

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"Add a comment to PROJ-456: 'Code review completed, ready for testing'"*
- *"Comment on the login issue that it's been deployed to staging"*
- *"Add testing results to issue PROJ-789"*

### üîÑ Workflow Management

Ask your AI assistant:
- *"What are the available statuses in the DEV project?"*
- *"Show me all possible workflow states"*
- *"What status options are available for project MOBILE?"*
- *"List the workflow states for issue transitions"*

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" or "403 Forbidden"

1. **Check your API Token permissions**:
   - Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
   - Make sure your token is still active and hasn't expired

2. **Verify your site name format**:
   - If your Jira URL is `https://mycompany.atlassian.net`
   - Your site name should be just `mycompany`

3. **Test your credentials**:
   ```bash
   # Test your credentials work
   npx -y @dmikushin/mcp-server-atlassian-jira ls-projects
   ```

### "Project not found" or "Issue not found"

1. **Check project key spelling**:
   ```bash
   # List your projects to see the correct keys
   npx -y @dmikushin/mcp-server-atlassian-jira ls-projects
   ```

2. **Verify access permissions**:
   - Make sure you have access to the project in your browser
   - Some projects may be restricted to certain users

### "No results found" when searching

1. **Try different search terms**:
   - Use project keys instead of project names
   - Try broader search criteria

2. **Check issue permissions**:
   - You can only access issues you have permission to view
   - Ask your admin if you should have access to specific projects

### Claude Desktop Integration Issues

1. **Restart Claude Desktop** after updating the config file
2. **Check the status bar** for the "üîó jira" indicator
3. **Verify config file location**:
   - macOS: `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json`

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What permissions do I need?

Your Atlassian account needs:
- **Access to Jira** with the appropriate permissions for the projects you want to query
- **API token** with appropriate permissions (automatically granted when you create one)

### Can I use this with Jira Server (on-premise)?

Currently, this tool only supports **Jira Cloud**. Jira Server/Data Center support may be added in future versions.

### How do I find my site name?

Your site name is the first part of your Jira URL:
- URL: `https://mycompany.atlassian.net` ‚Üí Site name: `mycompany`
- URL: `https://acme-corp.atlassian.net` ‚Üí Site name: `acme-corp`

### What AI assistants does this work with?

Any AI assistant that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP):
- Claude Desktop (most popular)

- Continue.dev
- Many others

### Is my data secure?

Yes! This tool:
- Runs entirely on your local machine
- Uses your own Jira credentials
- Never sends your data to third parties
- Only accesses what you give it permission to access

### Can I search across multiple projects?

Yes! When you don't specify a project, searches will look across all projects you have access to. You can also use JQL queries for advanced cross-project searches.
